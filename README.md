# A simple BBS application
This is a simple BBS application that can insert and read only, so it cannot make planks, and upload images.
The application connects to my server that has MySQL database.

# How to use
The application is made in Java, so you should install Java 21 to your computer, but I made a 64-bit executable file.
So if your computer's OS is 64-bit Windows, you can download and execute this.
